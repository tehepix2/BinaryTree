# BinaryTree

Family Tree


Design and implement an application that stores your own (real or otherwise) family tree in a binary tree and then prints the tree.  
Put yourself at the root, and your parents/guardians (real or otherwise) as your “children” in the tree, with their parents being 
their children, and so on.
